FINAL PROJECT THAT HELPS MEMORIZE THE 26 LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET, WITH DESCRIPTIONS
# Members: Trung Huynh, Kevin Pham, Kristine Catimbang, Bao Phung


# Description
This project is based on the alphabet, where users can click on each of the letters to get a short description of various objects or people that start with that letter, as a type of mnemonic device to help memorize the alphabet. 

# Desired Outcome (change if I'm wrong)
1. Display all 26 letters of the alphabet, in a box, aligned side to side.
2. Clicking on each letter (or box surrounding the letter) will popup a modal with some description of the letter.
3. Possibly be able to dynamically show a single letter in the url, based on its appropriate index number.  
4. In the server side of this project, each individual page will have either an image or a video to display, and each page  
    will be given an option to dynamically add comments that "react" to the displays.
